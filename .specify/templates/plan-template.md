# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Code Quality Gates:**
- [ ] All code will include type hints for public functions and classes
- [ ] Code will pass Ruff linting checks as configured in pyproject.toml
- [ ] Code will pass Ruff formatting checks
- [ ] Code will pass Pyright type checking as configured in pyrightconfig.json
- [ ] All modules will include module-level docstrings
- [ ] All public classes and functions will include docstrings
- [ ] No circular dependencies will be introduced
- [ ] Object models (classes, dataclasses, TypedDict, Pydantic) will be used instead of plain dictionaries for type safety
- [ ] Function calls will use named arguments (except single obvious argument cases)

**Testing Gates:**
- [ ] Test-Driven Development (TDD) will be used: tests written before implementation for all application code
- [ ] Test coverage plan achieves minimum 80% (95%+ for financial calculations) for application code (simulator and Flask app)
- [ ] Tests will use pytest framework with proper fixtures
- [ ] Integration tests planned for API endpoints
- [ ] Test performance targets defined (<1s unit, <10s integration)
- [ ] If feature includes standalone scripts/notebooks: Exception documented per constitution Testing Standards (only for scripts/notebooks NOT used as inputs for the application)

**User Experience Gates:**
- [ ] API endpoints follow consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Error messages will be clear and actionable
- [ ] Response time targets defined (<2s for interactive endpoints)
- [ ] Configuration validation planned

**Performance Gates:**
- [ ] Performance benchmarks defined for simulation operations
- [ ] Profiling strategy identified for critical paths
- [ ] Memory usage constraints considered
- [ ] Scalability considerations documented

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
